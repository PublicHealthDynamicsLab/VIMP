## Installation

You must install the following python modules, ideally in 3.12.11:
* ollama
* pandas
* simplejson

## Initialization

To open the server, run ``Server.py`` from the VIMP folder. If the folder is moved, you must update the relative paths in ``ServerCore.handle_get`` in ``Server.py`. The server may take about 20 seconds to initialize, as the majority of data processing is done before hosting.

To change LLM backbones, you may extend the implementation in ollamawrap for the appropriate API or change the ollama model argument provided to ``LlmBackbone`` in Server.py
